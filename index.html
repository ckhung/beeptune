        <h1>Beeptune</h1>

<p>Beeptune plays a simple tune file using the primitive system beep.
A tune file simply contains lines of musical notes and their durations.
You can write a tune file for "little star", for example,
and play it using beeptune.

<h3>Why Beeptune</h3>

<p>Beeptune is lightweight and can be run in a console.
It can be used to convey many bits of information
in situations where the user cannot (or does not wish to)
read from the screen. For example, it could be used in
linux distributions for the blind, in debugging services
and boot scripts, or as a poor man's alarm for notebook
battery low power.

<p>And finally, it's just fun. Theoretically, it could be
used to create a perfect soundtrack for the <a href=

ASCII art version of Star Wars</a> :-)

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>You need to do the following before you can use beeptune.
<ol>
<li>Install the debian or rpm package <code>beep</code>.
<li>Use the command <code>alsamixer</code> to <a href=
"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beep">
turn on the volume of "beep"</a>. <em>Make sure that
the label below the channel is "00" instead of "MM" .</em>
</ol>

<h3>Running Beeptune</h3>

<p>The beeptune command accepts 0 or more "tune" files as
command line arguments. It plays each file in order.
If there is no command line argument, it reads from
the standard input as if it were a tune file.
You can find sample tune files in the <code>examples/</code>
directory. For example,
<code>./beeptune examples/little-star.tune</code>
plays "little star" using the system beep.

<p>The playing speed can be changed with the <code>-s</code> option.
For example, <code>./beeptune -s 5 examples/cuckoo-waltz.tune</code>
plays "the cuckoo waltz" five times faster, while
<code>./beeptune -s 0.5 examples/cuckoo-waltz.tune</code>
plays it at half the speed.

<p>The tune can be played at a higher or lower tone.
For example, <code>./beeptune -b 7 examples/beautiful-dreamer.tune</code>
plays "beautiful dreamer" at 7 semitones higher, while
<code>./beeptune -b -12 examples/beautiful-dreamer.tune</code>
plays it at an octave (12 semitones) lower.
